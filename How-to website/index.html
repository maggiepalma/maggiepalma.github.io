    <div id="section1" class="container-fluid" style="padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom:25px; padding-left:20px; margin-bottom: -25px; background-color:#fcf7ee;">

      <h2 style="font-family: noto serif; font-weight: 400;">Before interview</h2>

        <h3 style="font-family: noto serif; font-weight:200">Research the company</h3>

          <p style="font-family: merriweather; font-weight: lighter;">
            A great place to start preparing for your interview is to take time to learn about the company’s mission, vision and coals. The knowledge you get from this research is a fantastic way to show you’re interested in the position, provide context for your conversation and create thoughtful answers for each question.
          </p>

      <h3 style="font-family: noto serif; font-weight:200">Prepare a story/pitch about yourself</h3>

        <p style="font-family: merriweather; font-weight: lighter;">
          One of the first things an interviewer will ask you to do is to introduce yourself. Be ready for it and provide a quick overview of yourself and your skills. When creating your short answer make sure to use impactful key words/events to describe who you are and your interests. Make sure to practice this in front a friend or family member until your answer comes naturally and confident.
        </p>
    
      <h3 style="font-family: noto serif; font-weight:200">Examine the job description</h3>

        <p style="font-family: merriweather; font-weight: lighter;">
          Use the posted job description as a guide to your list of qualifications, qualities and background. These characteristics are what the employer is looking for in an ideal candidate, so the more boxes you check off the more the employee will be able to see that you are qualified. Be ready to explain your qualifications to your interviewer.
        </p>

      <h3 style="font-family: noto serif; font-weight:200">Create a portfolio/samples of your work</h3>

        <p style="font-family: merriweather; font-weight: lighter;">
          As a journalist it is always a great idea to have clips ready of your best work. They can show the employer the stories you are most proud of and how great of a journalist you are. Bring them with you as well as your resume and cover letter to give to the interviewer.
        </p>

      <h3 style="font-family: noto serif; font-weight:200">Create a story pitch</h3>

       <p style="font-family: merriweather; font-weight: lighter;">
        It is a good idea to come up with a couple of stories that could fit the group you are interviewing with. To do so it is good to keep up with news, trends and events going on around the world/locally. This shows you took the time to read some of the stories the company published and some strong pieces that would benefit their publication.
      </p>

        <h3 style="font-family: noto serif; font-weight:200">Write questions for the end of the interview</h3>

          <p style="font-family: merriweather; font-weight: lighter;">
            Creating a thoughtful list of questions about the company and job is important to help you decide if the internship meets your needs while also showing you are genuinely interested in the position. Some examples are:
            <ul>
              <li>What is the work environment like?</li>
              <li>What is the biggest challenge of the position?</li>
             <li>What is the difference between an intern and a full-time employee?</li>
            <li>How would you describe a typical day in this position?</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

      <h2 style="font-family: noto serif; font-weight: 400;">Dressing the part</h2>

        <p style="font-family: merriweather; font-weight: lighter;">
          Whether the interview is online or in person it is extremely important to dress appropriately for it. Take time before your interview to put together an outfit that is professional.

<!--Basic questions-->
  
  <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
    <div id="section2" class="container-fluid" style="padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom:33px; padding-left:20px; margin-bottom: -25px; background-color:#fcf7ee;">
      <h2 style="font-family: noto serif; font-weight: 400;">Basic questions</h2>
        <h3 style="font-family: noto serif; font-weight:200">Why do you want an internship here?</h3>
          <p style="font-family: merriweather; font-weight: lighter;">This is an example of how researching the company is important. You will also be able to explain why you are a good fit for the internship. Be specific in your answer, but some examples are the company’s reputation, achievements, culture or how it may help with your professional goals</p>
    
        <h3 style="font-family: noto serif; font-weight:200">Why do you want to be a journalist?</h3>
          <p style="font-family: merriweather; font-weight: lighter;">An important answer to prepare for is this one just like the story/pitch about yourself. You can tell the employer who/what inspired you to become a journalist and where you want to go with your career and what you want to do with your degree. </p>
    
        <h3 style="font-family: noto serif; font-weight:200">What is in the news that is relevant to us?</h3>
          <p style="font-family: merriweather; font-weight: lighter;">Just like the last question, preparation is important for this one. Not only is your story pitch important, but also research. Come up with topics that you enjoy. Be prepared to explain why you think the stories are important and why you think they are interesting.</p>

        <h3 style="font-family: noto serif; font-weight:200">How do you manage tight deadlines?</h3>
         <p style="font-family: merriweather; font-weight: lighter;">This is the equivalent of “how do you stay organized” for journalists. In each journalist’s career, no matter how young, they will have to face a fast deadline. As a student it is also great to discuss your time management with schoolwork on top of deadlines.</p>

        <h3 style="font-family: noto serif; font-weight:200">If you could improve your writing, what would you change?</h3>
           <p style="font-family: merriweather; font-weight: lighter;">The best thing for a journalist to do is take responsibility and admit when they’re wrong. This is a fantastic time to address your writing strengths quickly, but make sure you take ownership. As a student and a journalist, you will always be learning. Be ready with real examples of what you did wrong.</p>

    <!--Final tips-->
    <div id="section4" class="container-fluid" style="padding-top: 25px; padding-bottom:25px; padding-left:20px; margin-bottom: -25px; background-color:#fcf7ee;">
      <h2 style="font-family: noto serif; font-weight: 400;">Final tips</h2>
        <h3 style="font-family: noto serif; font-weight:200">Participate in practice interviews</h3>
         <p style="font-family: merriweather; font-weight: lighter;">The overall best way to prepare for your interview is to practice. Whether it is with a friend, family member, professional or coworker it can help ease any nerves you may have. Make sure to wear the outfit you choose, practice your answers and pitch about yourself to make it more coherent and natural.</p>

        <h3 style="font-family: noto serif; font-weight:200">Be organized</h3>
          <p style="font-family: merriweather; font-weight: lighter;">It doesn’t matter if your interview is in person or virtual, you should have a pad of paper and a pen with you. Use it to keep track of your question and write notes through out the interview. If it is in person make sure to bring extra copies of your samples.</p>

        <h3 style="font-family: noto serif; font-weight:200">Ask for clarification in questions</h3>
          <p style="font-family: merriweather; font-weight: lighter;">It doesn’t hurt to ask for extra clarification before answering a question. It’s also a good idea to take your time before answering a question to compose your thoughts.</p>

        <h3 style="font-family: noto serif; font-weight:200">Be confident</h3>
          <p style="font-family: merriweather; font-weight: lighter;">The best thing for your interview is to be confident. There is no reason to stress out, so show yourself off. Don’t become too full of yourself, though, find the happy medium. Be yourself because you’re being interviewed for the company to see who you are up close.</p>
 
        <h3 style="font-family: noto serif; font-weight:200">Write a thank you</h3>

          <p style="font-family: merriweather; font-weight: lighter;">
            Following your interview take the time to send a thank you note to your interviewer. Use it as a time to follow up with the conversation. If you spoke about a certain article, send it to them. If there is a new development in a story you talked about, mention it. Your options are endless.
